change the way difficulty is calculated so tht there is a minimum distance from the correct value that the options are allowed to be

time in alerts is slightly off

Seperate and centralize end conditions

only show welcome modal if the player is new (put warning about localstorage in modal if their's isn't being allowed)

toggle settings menu too what it isn't when settings is pressed, to account for different behavior across browsers.

figure out how to add an event listener to the change of a value in a form so I can trigger it when I set the value from settings

Timer is always 1 ms off on screen, but is up to date in alert

Make display period longer in untimed gamemodes, or make it a setting

Change the settings to a menu that slides up from the bottom.
